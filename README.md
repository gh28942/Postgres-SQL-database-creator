# Postgres SQL database creator
A PHP script that connects to a postgres SQL database and runs "create table" as well as "insert" statements.

Creates a postgres SQL database based on a model I have designed (UML Diagram, UML Notation) and fills each table with 777 rows. The contents of the tables are random. 

Includes attributes of [type](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/datatype.html) integer, varchar, date, float, xml.
